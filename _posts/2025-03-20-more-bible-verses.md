I'm convinced the best discipline I've picked up over the last six months has been memorizing Scripture. For years, I've heard Christians who memorize Scripture tout the benefits of the practice. I've read stories of persecuted Christians who were sustained by Scripture they had memorized. Now, I'm experiencing those benefits for the first time. When I am struggling, the Bible verses that I've memorized are called to mind much more quickly. 

As the Lord reveals sin in my heart, or as I struggle with anxiety and fear, I've come across more verses that I want to add to my memorization list. Some of these were sent to me by my husband, or I came across them in my daily Bible reading, or I heard them in a sermon. They all specifically speak to something that I need to work on or remember on a daily basis. 

## How I Memorize Scripture

The way I memorize Scripture is nothing fancy--just the old-school index card way. Though there are plenty of Scripture memory apps, I only use one if I'm traveling. At home, I have never liked using technology in my quiet time and I find flash cards the most effective way to memorize verses. I keep them in a passport holder with my Bible. The stack of cards I've already memorized stay on one side of the holder and the verses in queue stay on the other side. It takes me about 5 minutes or so to go through all of the ones I've already memorized. Once I can go through the set without a mistake, I add another verse to the stack and begin working on memorizing it. 

And that's about it. It's very simple, but it's become a non-negotiable part of my morning routine. One thing I'd like to do is begin memorizing larger chunks of Scripture. I'm working on Romans 8, but the index card method is not ideal for memorizing whole chapters of the Bible, so I'm considering how I might need to switch it up for this particular passage.

Below are a handful of verses I've recently added to my stack. You can find the first set of verses [here](https://www.meredithcook.net/bible-verses). 

(All verses are referenced in the CSB version.)

#### Romans 8:1-4
*Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus, because the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering, in order that the lawâ€™s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.*

#### Psalm 131:1-3
*Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I do not get involved with things too great or too wondrous for me. Instead, I have calmed and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like a weaned child. Israel, put your hope in the Lord, both now and forever.*

#### Philippians 1:6
*I am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.*

#### 1 Peter 5:6-7
*Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your cares on him, because he cares about you.*

#### James 4:6-8a
*But he gives greater grace. Therefore he says: "God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble." Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.*

#### James 1:2-4
*Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials, because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.*
