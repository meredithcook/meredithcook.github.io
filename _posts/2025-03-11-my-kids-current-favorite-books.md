Every once in a while, I like to share our family's favorite children's books (you can find our <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/favorite-board-books">favorite board books here</a>) and <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/my-favorite-kids-books">my personal favorites here</a>). Today I'm sharing what my kids are currently loving. Of course, this changes from week to week, but here are a handful of consistent favorites. 

## What They Both Love

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/4eXOX3N" target= "blank"><i>Marvel Storybook Collection</i></a>
    <br>
  <br>I mentioned these storybook collections on my <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/book-gift-guide">Christmas gift guide</a> last year and these are still a fan favorite.

## My 5 Year Old's Favorites

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/4eOQs5d" target= "blank"><i>If I Built a Car</i></a>
  <br>Chris Van Dusen
  <br>Puffin Books, 2007
  <br>
  <br>I first discovered this book at my aunt's house. My aunt was an elementary school media specialist and I always loved going with her to her library when I was younger. She's still an expert in kids' books and the <a href= "https://amzn.to/3YiuNLP" target= "blank"><i>If I Built</i></a> series are some of my most favorite books to read to my kids. The rhymes are fun, easy to read, and make sense (you don't always get all three in a rhyming book) and the whole premise of this series is creative. While <i>If I Built a Car</i> is my favorite of the trilogy, I highly recommend all three.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3NEf6cW" target= "blank"><i>The Office: A Day at Dunder Mifflin Elementary</i></a>
  <br>Robb Pearlman
  <br>Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, 2020
  <br>
  <br>As a big fan of <i>The Office</i> TV series, this was a must-have for our kids' library. My kids are kind of "meh" about it, but I absolutely love the book. There are so many tiny references and callbacks to the show that make it a truly enjoyable read if you're a fan.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3U5qWRa" target= "blank"><i>The Greatest Book Ever</i></a>
  <br>Teresa Joyelle Krager
  <br>B&H Kids, 2023
  <br>
  <br><i>The Greatest Book Ever</i> is fun, bright, and piques kids' curiosity about the Bible. I <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/review-the-greatest-book-ever">wrote a review</a> of this book earlier this year if you'd like more reasons why I love it so much.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3YB95UD" target= "blank"><i>Green Eggs and Ham</i></a>
  <br>Dr. Seuss
  <br>Beginner Books/Random House, 1960
  <br>
  <br>To be quite honest, I find a lot of Dr. Seuss books get a bit long in the tooth as read-alouds. I do love <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>, though. It's a fast-paced, fun read that the kids and I both enjoy.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3NyP4aW" target= "blank"><i>The Mitten</i></a>
  <br>Jan Brett
  <br>Scholastic, 1990
  <br>
  <br>I remember reading <i>The Mitten</i> as a child and the adults around me loving the illutrations. At the time, I didn't appreciate them, but now I totally understand. While some of the stories she uses are adapted from old fables or fairy tales, it's the illustrations that are truly fantastic. We also love her version of <a href="https://amzn.to/4dXzel0" target="blank"><i>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</i></a>.
