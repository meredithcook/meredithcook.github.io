Every once in a while, I like to share our family's favorite children's books (you can find our <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/favorite-board-books">favorite board books here</a>) and <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/my-favorite-kids-books">my personal favorites here</a>). Today I'm sharing what my kids are currently loving. Of course, this changes from week to week, but here are a handful of consistent favorites. 

## What They Both Love

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/4eXOX3N" target= "blank"><i>Marvel Storybook Collection</i></a>
    <br>
  <br>I mentioned these storybook collections on my <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/book-gift-guide">Christmas gift guide</a> last year and these are still a fan favorite. 
</p>

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3G2e3mkN" target= "blank"><i>Little Golden Books</i></a>
    <br>
  <br>If my kids reach for a book, 9/10 times they're picking a Little Golden Book, and it's probably this one about <i>The Incredibles</i>. There's a reason these have always been a classic! We have quite a few of these, including the <a href="https://amzn.to/4jt9Oyy" target="blank">Disney Princess</a> box set and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3XUJnJX" target="blank">Paw Patrol</a> box set.

## My 5 Year Old's Favorites

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3U5qWRa" target= "blank"><i>The Greatest Book Ever</i></a>
  <br>Mary Pope Osborne
  <br>Random House, 2010
  <br>
  <br><i>The Magic Treehouse: Dinosaurs Before Dark</i> has become a huge hit for my daughter. She reads it over and over. She has also read <a href= "https://amzn.to/4cxOEgA" target="blank"><i>The Knight at Dawn</i></a> and likes it, but not quite as much.
</p>

<a href="https://amzn.to/42pvYuL" target="blank"><img src="meredithcook.github.io/images/boxcar.jpg" alt="The Boxcar Children" style="width:250px;height:275px;padding:10px" align="center"></a><p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/42pvYuL" target= "blank"><i>The Boxcar Children</i></a>
  <br>Gertrude Chandler Warner
  <br>Random House, 1989
  <br>
  <br>We cut the kids' teeth on <i>The Boxcar Children</i> series when I found <a href= "https://amzn.to/3EkLnVh" target= "blank">an early reader version</a> of the series at the library. I recently bought my daughter the box set of the actual chapter books, wanting to give her some longer and more challenging books to read. She loved the first one.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3YrQM3y" target= "blank"><i>Fancy Nancy</i></a>
  <br>Jane O'Connor
  <br>Harper Collins
  <br>
  <br><i>Fancy Nancy</i> has been a years-long favorite for my daughter. These are the first books she goes for at the library. 
</p>

<a href="https://amzn.to/3YB95UD" target="blank"><img src="meredithcook.github.io/images/greeneggs.jpg" alt="Green Eggs and Ham" style="width:250px;height:300px;padding:10px" align="center"></a><p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3YB95UD" target= "blank"><i>Green Eggs and Ham</i></a>
  <br>Dr. Seuss
  <br>Beginner Books/Random House, 1960
  <br>
  <br>To be quite honest, I find a lot of Dr. Seuss books get a bit long in the tooth as read-alouds. I do love <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>, though. It's a fast-paced, fun read that the kids and I both enjoy.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3NyP4aW" target= "blank"><i>The Mitten</i></a>
  <br>Jan Brett
  <br>Scholastic, 1990
  <br>
  <br>I remember reading <i>The Mitten</i> as a child and the adults around me loving the illutrations. At the time, I didn't appreciate them, but now I totally understand. While some of the stories she uses are adapted from old fables or fairy tales, it's the illustrations that are truly fantastic. We also love her version of <a href="https://amzn.to/4dXzel0" target="blank"><i>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</i></a>.
