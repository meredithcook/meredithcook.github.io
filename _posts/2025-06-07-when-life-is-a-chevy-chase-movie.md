The last two weeks have been quite eventful in the Cook household. Septic tank issues and a busted pipe under our house had us making phone call after phone call to a septic company, a plumber, a water damage company, and our insurance agent. At the same time, we had to replace the AC in my car, rounding out a nice trifecta of maintenance issues. Add to that our resident snake[^1] disrupting our repair work and the fact that this all happened right before an out-of-town work trip for both my husband and I.

In short, our life over the last two weeks has been a Chevy Chase movie.

I would be lying if I said it had not been a bit stressful, but two weeks of one-thing-after-another has had me reflecting on just how much we have to be grateful for. It seems odd to even write about this, because all things considered, these are a mere inconvenience for us--and that in and of itself has held me back from grumbling about it (well, from grumbling more than I would have otherwise). 

## Cultivating Gratitude

I resonate with Nancy Demoss Wolgemuth when she writes, "In my own life I find that a default position, hidden beneath the surface, is an ever-present 'entitlement' attitude. This, more than any other single thing I can identify, is my biggest problem." ([*Choosing Gratitude*](https://amzn.to/3HuXfFv), 55[^2]) Ingratitude, and specifically entitlement, leads down a road of spiritual destruction, stealing our joy and distancing us from God and others. It steals our joy and causes unbelief. When Scripture says to give thanks in all circumstances (1 Thessalonians 5:18), the imperative nature of that verse signals to us that doing what it says is, in fact, possible. 

If the last two weeks have revealed anything, it's been to convict me of my natural tendency to grumble and to remind me of the Lord's providential care even in the tiniest of details. 

With this in mind, and knowing my tendency toward ingratitude, I wanted to write down a list of all the things I'm grateful for through the last couple of weeks of home headaches. 

- I am thankful for the reminder that these are not big problems, particularly when compared with the suffering so many are currently experiencing. 

- There's the Lord's sovereignty over seemingly unconsequential actions that led us to discover the burst pipe in the first place. We have well water (so, no water bill to monitor water usage), and it could have been weeks before we realized it was happening.

- For two sets of parents who were very flexible. They all came to visit for my daughter's kindergarten graduation and had to stay in other accommodations since our home was not exacly livable for a day or so.

- For guest housing at our seminary. We stayed there a night while our water was shut off. 

- For kids who are not thrown by all the insanity. Honestly, they had a blast getting an unexpected sleepover in a hotel-like room.

-  For responsive companies and insurance who have helped us get started on the process of repairs.

-  For in-laws who are happily taking care of our children and for a father-in-law who has no problem handling maintenance issues while we're gone.

-  For my parents, who were ready to be on-call in case any of our plans changed. 

-  For a husband who is not easily bothered. He's helped keep me sane the last couple of weeks. 

- For a church community always willing to step in and help if we need it, and to lend a sympathetic ear.  

- For the opportunity to trust the Lord and witness His working. In the grand scheme of things, these maintenance issues are small matters, but we have witnessed the Lord's providential care in the tiniest of details. How much more will He care for us in truly difficult circumstances?

[^1] We have a (quite large) black snake that lives around our house, that we see about once a year and that apparently lives under the house this week. We call him Burt. I'm no fan of Burt, but we leave him alone because he deals with larger problems (rodents and poisonous snakes). Unfortunately, he has to be removed so the companies can do their work under the house.  

[^2] I think this the right page number, but it's hard to tell on the e-reader app that I use.
