  <br>My friend, Val, has written two great kids books (you can check out the first one <a href="https://amzn.to/41wLYup" target="blank">here</a>). Her newest, <a href= "https://amzn.to/41LPgLF" target= "blank"><i>Let's Go! Bible Adventures</i></a> combines sweet rhymes and Biblical truth with a fun transportation theme. With 20 stories from the Old Testament and 20 from the New Testament, kids will learn about many familiar Bible characters and how God worked through each of their stories to accomplish His plan. The transportation theme is a fun twist on your typical Bible storybook and my kids are loving it. I am always very impressed by kids book authors who can manage to create a good rhyming book--I tried that for about 5 minutes with my own book and quickly gave up. I highly recommend this one!
