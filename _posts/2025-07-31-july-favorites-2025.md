July saw my husband and my 9th anniversary, the [beginning of school](https://www.meredithcook.net/five-prayers-for-back-to-school) for our oldest, [continued work on repairing our house](https://www.meredithcook.net/when-life-is-a-chevy-chase-movie), and lots of prayers for family health (so far, good news, praise the Lord). I also began [*The Anxious Generation*](https://amzn.to/3IVvWVt) by Jonathan Haidt and began questioning all of my parenting decisions.

# Reads

- [*Big Dumb Eyes*](https://amzn.to/4fdElQ1){:target="_blank"} by Nate Bargatze. I began this book in June and finished it early this month. It's exactly what you would expect from Nate Bargatze, if you've ever heard his comedy. Hysterical, laughed out loud in some parts. 

## Articles
Due to beginning *The Anxious Generation*, I did not get a lot of articles read this month. But here are two for your consideration: 

### [The Gift of Middle Age: Enjoy Your Lot.](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/gift-middle-age-enjoy/?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Trevin Wax
<br>TGC

A reflection on middle age, that resonates with me as I quickly approach my forties.

### [Coldplaygate is a reminder that there's no escaping going viral](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/coldplaygate-is-a-reminder-that-theres-no-escaping-going-viral?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us&__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Kyle Chayka
<br>The New Yorker

An interesting reflection on going viral and how social media has turned life into what this writer calls an "interactive reality show."

# Things I'm Loving

- My husband and I celebrated our anniversary by going out to dinner the night before he had a quick trip out of town. He rented a car for that trip, and the rental place let him drive home a sports car for the evening. So we took our date in style!
- Earlier this month, my husband and I got to participate in a retreat our church sponsored for all the members of our church who will be sent as international missionaries in the next year. It was a sweet time and such a privilege to be part of sending and supporting these friends. I am so thankful we get to be part of this. 
- Our son has recently discovered a love of baseball.  We took the kids to a couple of games this month and he has had a blast.
