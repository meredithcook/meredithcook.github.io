Sometimes I come across things I'd like to share online, but since cutting out all social media, there's not been a venue for me to do this--until I realized I could just share them here! I've been regularly sharing my favorite articles every month, but wanted to expand to other types of media (podcasts, videos, etc) and keep a record of some of my favorite moments of the month. Here we go:

# Reads

I read two books in February: 

- [*Redeeming Productivity*](https://amzn.to/3F7T7dq){:target="_blank"} by Reagan Rose. I've read a lot of productivity/time management/habit formation books, secular and Christian, and this one was by far the best one I've read on the Christian side. 

- [*Sisters First*](https://amzn.to/4btS1o4){:target="_blank"} by Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Pierce Bush. This is an older one, but I had never read it. I love a good first family memoir/biography and this one didn't disappoint. 

### [Writes and Write-Nots](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html?__readwiseLocation={:target="_blank"}
Paul Graham

This article inspired [my own article](https://www.meredithcook.net/how-I-use-AI) from earlier this month. Writing can be intimidating and as AI makes it increasingly easier for non-writers to produce writing, it may also effectively decrease the critical thinking skills that are necessary to write well.

### [We Live Like Royalty and Don't Know It](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/we-live-like-royalty-and-dont-know-it?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Charles C. Mann
<br>The New Atlantis

This article sat with me longer than I expected it to and I've thought about it several times since I read it. I'm not sure where he's going with practical applications in this article, and I haven't yet read the series of articles that follows it, but I do think it's a thought-provoking read and should lead us to consider how fortunate we are to live in a time and context where our systems work for us most of the time.

### [The Forces of Chance](https://aeon.co/essays/without-chaos-theory-social-science-will-never-understand-the-world?ref=thebrowser.com&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Brian Klaas
<br>Aeon

A longer read but fascinating, and a bit anxiety inducing if I'm being honest! Our world is affected by flukes much more than I'd like to admit and this article shows just how hard it is to predict human behavior.

# Watch/Listen

### [Backstreet Boys' SNL 50 Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iAKNEBghmw){:target="_blank"}

As a child of the late 90s/early 2000s, I needed this video in my life and particularly enjoyed Paul Rudd rocking out to BSB. 

### [Diary of a CEO: Vanessa Van Edwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHUrdELKjDw&t=122s&__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}

This is a long one and I listened to it like a podcast. Though I don't agree with everything she says, I found much of her information helpful. (A bit of NSFW language in this one.)
