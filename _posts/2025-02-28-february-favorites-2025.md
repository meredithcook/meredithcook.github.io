Sometimes I come across things I'd like to share online, but since cutting out all social media, there's not been a venue for me to do this--until I realized I could just share them here! I've been regularly sharing my favorite articles every month, but wanted to expand to other types of media (podcasts, videos, etc) and keep a record of some of my favorite moments of the month. Here we go:

# Favorite Reads

### [Finding God's Will](https://idcraleigh.com/sermons/january-18-2015-acts-112-26-finding-gods-will/?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Jim Shaddix
<br> Imago Dei Church Raleigh

This week, the world lost a giant of the faith, [Dr. Jim Shaddix](https://www.sebts.edu/jim-shaddix-life-remembered/){:target="_blank"}. It was a great privilege to sit under his teaching and learn from him. I heard him preach this sermon in January 2015, at a time when I most needed to hear it. I vividly remember how comforted and encouraged I felt after he preached this. Pray for his wife, children, and grandchildren and for the Southeastern community grieving his loss.

### [The Teenage Prank That's Lasted 60 Years](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-teenage-prank-that-s-lasted-60-years?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us&__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Clay Jennings Desmond
<br>Narratively

This made me and my husband laugh out loud more than once. We both grew up in contexts similar to what the author describes and I could picture any number of my guy friends in high school doing these exact shenanigans.

### [Will I Suffer My Singleness Forever?](https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/will-i-suffer-my-singleness-forever?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
John Piper
<br>Desiring God

It is so hard in our American context to swallow the truth that God's word never guarantees us a life of ease, comfort, or met desires. It's particularly hard for those of us who have, for one reason or another, lived a mostly comfortable life. Piper provides a needed reminder that "the New Testament presents the Christian life as shot through with sorrow and pain and disappointment and affliction and rejection and persecution — all of it sustained with gladness by rejoicing in the 'hope of the glory of God' (Romans 5:1–2)".

### [Why kids should read obituaries](https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/why-kids-should-read-obituaries/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Peter Sipe
<br>Commonwealth Beacon

Sipe makes the point that reading obituaries are about life and that kids can gain by reading them. Obituaries can inform and inspire. As a Christian, I agree with him but I also think it's important for another reason- death teaches us about God just like life does.
