Every once in a while, I like to share our family's favorite children's books (you can find our <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/favorite-board-books">favorite board books here</a> and <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/my-favorite-kids-books">my personal favorites here</a>). Today I'm sharing what my kids are currently loving. Of course, this changes from week to week, but here are a handful of consistent favorites. 

## What They Both Love

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/4eXOX3N" target= "blank"><i>Disney and Marvel Storybook Collections</i></a>
    <br>
  <br>I mentioned these storybook collections on my <a href="https://www.meredithcook.net/book-gift-guide">Christmas gift guide</a> last year and these are still a fan favorite.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3G7lSqV" target= "blank"><i>Little Golden Books</i></a>
    <br>
  <br>If my kids reach for a book, 9/10 times they're picking a Little Golden Book, and it's probably this one about <i>The Incredibles</i>. There's a reason these have always been a classic! We have quite a few of these, including the <a href="https://amzn.to/4jt9Oyy" target="blank">Disney Princess</a> box set and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3XUJnJX" target="blank">Paw Patrol</a> box set.

<h2>My 5 Year Old's Favorites</h2>

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/4j3UN6t" target= "blank"><i>The Magic Treehouse: Dinosaurs Before Dark</i></a>
  <br>Mary Pope Osborne
  <br>Random House, 2010
  <br>
  <br><i>The Magic Treehouse: Dinosaurs Before Dark</i> has become a huge hit for my daughter. She reads it over and over. She has also read <a href= "https://amzn.to/4cxOEgA" target="blank"><i>The Knight at Dawn</i></a> and likes it, but not quite as much.
</p>

<a href="https://amzn.to/42pvYuL" target="blank"><img src="meredithcook.github.io/images/boxcar.jpg" alt="The Boxcar Children" style="width:250px;height:310px;padding:10px" align="center"></a><p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/42pvYuL" target= "blank"><i>The Boxcar Children</i></a>
  <br>Gertrude Chandler Warner
  <br>Random House, 1989
  <br>
  <br>We cut the kids' teeth on <i>The Boxcar Children</i> series when I found <a href= "https://amzn.to/3EkLnVh" target= "blank">an early reader version</a> of the series at the library. I recently bought my daughter the box set of the actual chapter books, wanting to give her some longer and more challenging books to read. She loved the first one.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3YrQM3y" target= "blank"><i>Fancy Nancy</i></a>
  <br>Jane O'Connor
  <br>Harper Collins
  <br>
  <br><i>Fancy Nancy</i> has been a years-long favorite for my daughter. These are the first books she goes for at the library.

<h2>My 4 Year Old's Favorites</h2>

<a href="https://amzn.to/43MBo5v" target="blank"><img src="meredithcook.github.io/images/kitandkaboodle.jpg" alt="Kit and Kaboodle" style="width:250px;height:300px;padding:10px" align="center"></a><p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/43MBo5v" target= "blank"><i>Kit and Kaboodle Go Camping</i></a>
  <br>Michelle Portice
  <br>Highlights Press, 2020
  <br>
  <br>My kids have always loved a hunt-and-find book and my son especially enjoys the <i>Kit and Kaboodle</i> books. I like these because they're more challenging for him than others and they're actual books, too, so it's not just the hunt-and-find. There are a lot of books in the <a href="https://amzn.to/3ErKI4f" target="blank">Highlights Puzzle Readers Series</a>, but so far, we have only read the Kit and Kaboodle books.
</p>

<a href="https://amzn.to/4ieWayi" target="blank"><img src="meredithcook.github.io/images/cars.jpg" alt="Cars" style="width:250px;height:310px;padding:10px" align="center"></a><p>
  <a href= "https://amzn.to/4ieWayi" target= "blank"><i>The Cars Story Collection</i></a>
  <br>RH/Disney, 2011
  <br>
  <br>We are trying rather intentionally to teach our son to read early, because we've seen the benefits it's reaped in our daughter. So when he asked for books about Lightning McQueen, I thought this one might be a good motivator for him to start practicing his reading. Of course, he'll learn in his own time, but he does love this book and reaches for it on a regular basis.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/42BOkJk" target= "blank"><i>The Missing Piece</i></a>
  <br>Shel Silverstein
  <br>Harper & Row, 2006
  <br>
  <br>To be quite honest, I have no idea what it is about this book, but my son absolutely loves it. If we are reading a book before bedtime, this is the one he goes for 90 percent of the time. Both of my kids went through a pretty hardcore <a href="https://amzn.to/3RcuXkL" target="blank"><i>The Giving Tree</i></a>, phase, too.
