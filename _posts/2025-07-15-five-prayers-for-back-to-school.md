Tomorrow begins another school year for our oldest, who is starting first grade. While I maintain my love for the year-round school model, I have to admit that the summer felt a bit too short. Though it may move too fast for my liking, I am thankful for time, because it has a way of revealing that the things you were once a bit freaked out about are not so daunting after all. 

Last year, [kindergarten weighed heavily](https://www.meredithcook.net/eight-reflections-for-back-to-school) on me as I faced the reality of having a school-age child and all the uncertainties of sending our children outside of our home to be educated. Though many of those uncertainties are now assuaged by simply having experienced the first year of school, there's still a bit of discomfort sitting in the back of my brain as I prepare to send my child off to another school year. 

When it comes to worrying for my children, there is really no limit to what I worry about. However, I know that when Scripture tells us to "be anxious for nothing" (Philippians 4:6), then that means that by God's strength, it is within my capacity to not worry. That does not negate the need for prayer for my child, though, as she begins a new school year. Conversely, it is by these prayers that my fears are relieved. These are five prayers I am praying for back-to-school (for my child, and for her parents). 

## You love her more than I do and you love her perfectly.

The last year taught me that most of my fears about starting school were unfounded (shocker). This year, we face the school year a bit more confidently. Many of the unknowns about her school are now familiar. We know the teachers. We know who her friends are. We know some of their parents. Yet, we also recognize that any of that could change, anytime. 

If I have struggled with anything in parenting, I've struggled with the ~~belief~~ lie that my children are safest with me. Having experienced one year of school, and seeing that it turned out fine, does not silence that lie. I have to remind myself repeatedly that though I cannot be with them at all times, God is. He is sovereign over my kids' lives just as He is sovereign over everything else. And He is good. I can trust Him with my children. 

Our confidence and rest don't come from knowledge about her circumstances, her school, her grades, her friends, their families, or any host of objects in which we try to place our hope. Our confidence and rest come from trusting the God who loves us, and our children, perfectly. He knows exactly what is going on at all times. He is in control and He is working all things out for His glory and our good. 

## Help her to filter all things through the lens of what is true.

By God's grace, last year our daughter was accepted to a charter school whose values parallel ours to some degree. She's not getting a Christian education there by any means, but so far we have not had any major concerns about what she's being taught at school.

That said, we also know that she's at a public school and many of her teachers are not believers. Many of her friends do not come from believing families. The biblical teaching we uphold in our home will be challenged by her peers and likely also by some of her teachers. Though she's not faced it yet, and may not even face it this year, the likelihood of these challenges becomes more real the older she gets. So we must be praying now for the hope of the gospel to become more sure in her as she grows. 

I pray every day for my kids' salvation, and as my daughter ventures back out into the school world, I also pray that the foundation of truth we have laid since she was born will be strong. I pray she will only become more convinced of the truth as she grows older. I pray that my husband and I can help her navigate the questions she will inevitably have as she faces these challenges. 

## Help her to have confidence in the right things. 

Like the previous prayer, this is more of an anticipatory prayer than one related to our current experience. As our children begin to show signs of increasingly complicated emotions, we pray that ultimately their confidence rests in who they are as image bearers. That's a big ask for a child, and likely an even bigger ask as they grow into teenagers. Yet, while we recognize the reality and remember the challenges of our growing up years, we know that God is sufficient for our kids in all circumstances. 

We have no way of predicting whether our kids will struggle with friendships, peer pressure, body image, performing in academics or sports. However, just as we pray that biblical truth becomes the lens through which they interpret what they're being taught at school, we also pray that truth develops into a quiet confidence that is not shaken by the challenges of simply growing up. So we pray for God to give them strength to withstand the temptation to seek validation and identity in something other than the gospel.  

## Give us wisdom to help her navigate growing up. 

Related to the previous two, this one is on our behalf. We are quickly learning in this season that while the physical requirements of parenting tiny children subside as they enter the 4s and 5s, the emotional requirements are growing exponentially. Of course, they still need our physical presence and help with a lot of things, but we are confronting an increasing amount of emotional needs and struggles that are new to us as their parents. 

I'm so afraid we're going to get this part wrong. So, I'm praying even now that God will help me trust in His sovereignty and sufficiency for my husband and me. We do not raise these kids alone. We have the Holy Spirit who gives us wisdom for each moment, we have our own parents who modeled being good parents for us, we have a church community to support and encourage us, including parents whose children are older than ours and can speak wisdom into this season. 

## Help us to be good stewards of this time.  

I've learned, though, that [life frequently feels too short](https://www.meredithcook.net/this-is-the-day)--what I have not quite learned, yet, is how to steward the days well. I get too caught up in the minutiae of daily life and before I know it, the summer is gone. I'm tired of getting to the end of a season, even a short one like summer break, and feeling like I didn't take advantage of the time. I pray the Lord will, as Psalm 90:12 says, "Teach us to number our days carefully so that we may develop wisdom in our hearts."

In this season, that primarily means not squandering the times both of my kids are home and enjoying the time with them. Soon, the other will go to kindergarten and they will both be out of the house more often than not. While some priorities (like my job), are still pressing and necessary to steward, others (like cleaning the house) are less so. I am praying the Lord can help me sort those out in a better way. 

Not only that, but I'm also praying the Lord helps us to use this season for His glory. That means praying for gospel opportunities in and around my child's school. Connecting with other parents has been difficult, but it can't be impossible! I'm praying the Lord will give us wisdom to see how we can be more present with the families of my daughter's friends and give us opportunities to bear witness to the hope we have in Jesus.
