Our daughter's 6th birthday is coming up and we're always looking for new books to give her. We're happy to buy books for our kids anytime of the year, but birthdays are a good excuse to give a little extra. She loves, and has always loved, books, particularly since she learned how to read. If you're looking for some book ideas for little girls age 4 to 7, or around Kindergarten to 2nd grade, here are some suggestions. 

(Since there are not a ton of Christian books in this list, I want to note that these are books that I'm comfortable with my child reading. However, I do recommend vetting for yourself since every parent has different preferences, quirks, and boundaries for the type of media they allow their child to consume.)

## Bibles

One of the first gifts I knew I would buy my daughter when she went to Kindergarten was a Bible. At our church, children typically begin staying for the entire worship service at this point. So I wanted her to have a Bible she could start learning to use during corporate worship. It's also no secret that [we read a Bible storybook](https://www.meredithcook.net/how-we-do-family-worship) with our children every night, and those make good gifts, too. 

*The Biggest Story Bible Storybook* is a great option for kids this age. You can read my review [here](https://www.meredithcook.net/the-biggest-story-bible-storybook-review).

Last year, we bought our daughter a personalized, leather-cover version of the [*Easy for Me* Bible](https://amzn.to/3ViJEoP){:target="_blank"}. I think it's a really good starter Bible. It's pretty simple, with some inserts and front matter, but nothing too overwhelming for a young kid learning to read. She uses this in corporate worship during Scripture reading and doesn't have too much trouble finding the references. 

We also own the [*CSB Explorer Bible*.](https://amzn.to/4g5G0GU){:target="_blank"} Our daughter loves to look through it because it is bright, fun, and includes lots of extra information that she finds interesting. 

## Beloved Series

I loved the classic [*Amelia Bedelia*](https://amzn.to/3Hgb9vk){:target="_blank"} when I was younger, but I have found that the new, younger version of Amelia Bedelia is more accessible to my daughter at this age. She's not quite old enough to understand the humor of the classic version. I like that the newer version of Amelia Bedelia comes in both [early readers](https://amzn.to/4fofXLO){:target="_blank"} as well as [chapter books](https://amzn.to/4onQ7vr){:target="_blank"}. 

[*Fancy Nancy*](https://amzn.to/4flqAii){:target="_blank"} is right up my daughter's alley (though she's not near as dramatic as the titular character). She loves anything with a sparkle or a tutu, and even dressed up as Fancy Nancy for book character day in preschool. Like *Amelia Bedelia,* I like that these books come in both picture book and [chapter book](https://amzn.to/4lWobND){:target="_blank"} versions.

[*The Berenstain Bears*](https://amzn.to/4mt0nkc){:target="_blank"} have been a consistent favorite in our house (they were some of my favorite as a kid, too). While these might not be the most fun birthday-party books, both of my kids have enjoyed these for years and my daughter still reaches for them regularly.

## Chapter Books

Along with the chapter book options noted above, there are several great series for more advanced readers in this age group. [*The Magic Treehouse* series](https://amzn.to/4okdl5w){:target="_blank"} is my daughter's current favorite. She's read the first two books repeatedly, to the point where we are encouraging her to try something different!

I've only read one so far, but the [*A to Z Mysteries* series](https://amzn.to/4mcj6Rp){:target="_blank"} are fun, shorter chapter books revolving around three friends who solve mysteries together. To be determined, but some might be on the scarier side for more sensitive kids, so while I do think these are a fun choice, you might want to vet them first to make sure they're good for your child. (I was able to check one out from the library in the Libby app.)  

[*The Boxcar Children*](https://amzn.to/45i27pA){:target="_blank"} are another classic favorite (and another mystery series). It was fun watching my daughter read the first one, because these were one of my all-time favorite book series. 

## Other Picture Books

    <a href="https://amzn.to/3UgOVfB" target="blank"><img src="/images/princess.jpg"></a>
  </div>
</div>

The [*Do Great Things for God*](https://amzn.to/3Zxj0L8){:target="_blank"} series are some of my daughter's favorite books, which makes me happy since I want to [teach her all I can about missions and missionaries](https://www.meredithcook.net/why-we-teach-our-kids-about-missions).

We are also big fans of *Madeline* around here. We have read this one book more times than I can count, and it's always a winner if you need a good book to give as a gift.

Finally, the Disney princess storybooks have also been a consistent hit. Each story is about 5 minutes long, and our daughter loves picking out a couple of them to read in the evenings.
