It's been almost a year since *Go Tell Everyone: 9 Missionaries Who Shared the Good News* released! I still marvel at the privilege of being able to write this book and am so thankful for the stories from families who have benefitted from it. Today, I have two updates about the book to share with you.

# Outreach Magazine's Resources of the Year

Outreach magazine recently published a list of the past year's best books that emphasize outreach. I'm excited to share that *Go Tell Everyone* is included as an Also Recommended resource in their Kids and Youth segment!

# Posters Accompanying "Go Tell Everyone"

A while back, I received an email from someone requesting posters of some of the missionaries in my book to put up in their church's children's ministry. B&H graciously created four posters that correspond with the book, available to download for free. You can access these posters at [gotelleveryonebook.com](gotelleveryonebook.com), under the Resources section towards the bottom of the page.
