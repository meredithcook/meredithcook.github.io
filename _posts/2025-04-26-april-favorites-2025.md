It has been a sad week in our community and household as one of our favorite professors passed away after a battle with cancer. We loved and deeply respected Dr. Harper, and he was a great encouragement to both of us. We are sad that he is gone, but we are grateful that he is fully healed and in the presence of Jesus. So, while this is a more sad intro to this monthly post, I wanted to honor his memory.

# Reads

## Books

- [*What in the World*](https://amzn.to/4iA6roL){:target="_blank"} by Leanne Morgan. I have been on a memoir kick this year, and Leanne Morgan's memoir is a funny and quick read. I discovered her on YouTube and honestly thought she was doing a bit with her accent, until I watched enough videos to realize that it's real. I enjoy her comedy, especially as a female quickly approaching (or already approaching?) middle age. I did find that I was familiar with many of its anecdotes because I've watched enough of her stand-up routine. However, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of levity in their reading. 

## Articles

### [Missions, Illnesses and God](https://www.thecgcs.org/resources/post/missions-illnesses-and-god/?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Scarlett Johnson

Scarlett is a type-1 diabetic who also serves as a missionary overseas. In this article, she discusses how God's purposes carry forth despite our perceived limitations. It is full of hope and encouragement to follow God's call and trust His character throughout all of our struggles.

### [The Paradox of Ease: Why Friction is Good for You](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/paradox-ease/?__readwiseLocation){:target="_blank"}
Trevin Wax
<br>TGC

In an article that I desperately needed to read (and really, that many Americans need to read), Trevin Wax argues that facing challenges and experiencing resistance are essential for personal growth and happiness. This is counter to so much of the American way, particularly in recent generations.

### [High Agency in 30 Minutes](https://www.highagency.com/?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}

I am not a high agency person, but I am married to one. This is an entertaining look at what makes a person "High Agency" and while it may not make you High Agency, it's interesting to read about people who were.

The title is pretty straightforward, but I enjoyed this fun read reflecting on church coffee.

As someone who struggles with anxiety, one of the hardest character traits of God for me to wrap my mind around his His sovereignty. I grasp for control to try to alleviate anxiety.

# Watch/Listen

## YouTube Workout Channels

For the first time ever, I've been exercising regularly and have kept up the habit for about six months now. I just use free workout videos on YouTube, and these are the channels I turn to most:

### [Team Body Project](https://www.youtube.com/@BodyProjectchallenge/featured){:target="_blank"}

I enjoy this channel enough that I've seriously considered subscribing to their premium plan (I just can't justify paying for it when there are literally thousands of free workouts on YouTube). I like this channel because most of the videos are both challenging and are well-rounded (full-body) without making me feel like I'm going to die by the end. Though some workouts are at a higher level, you can check out the videos on their actual website to see the level of difficulty ahead of time, if you want to know what you're getting into before you start. 

### [PS Fit](https://www.youtube.com/@PS_Fit){:target="_blank"}

PS Fit used to be my go-to whenever I'd get into a temporary exercise routine. There are a lot of dance-type workouts which I used to do exclusively because I hated any other kind of exercise! Now, I use only 2-3 of the same videos when I'm wanting to do something familiar without having to think too much about it. 

### [fitbymik](https://www.youtube.com/@fitbymik){:target="_blank"}

This is one of my go-to channels for strength workouts. Her workouts are challenging without being too crazy and she's not annoying!

### [Get Fit with Rick](https://www.youtube.com/@rickbhullarfitness){:target="_blank"}

I discovered this channel a few years ago when I felt I didn't have the capacity to do any kind of exercise other than walking. I don't come to this channel often anymore, because I don't find it challenging enough, I do use these videos on rest days or when I'm not feeling well but still want to try to exercise a little bit. If I'm just wanting to walk and need a bit more challenge, I just speed up his video to 1.5 or even 2 (I don't think you can do this on YouTube but I use a different player, which lets me speed it up.)

# Things I'm Loving

- Our cherry blossom trees have bloomed and our driveway looks like it's snowed pink flowers. I love all of the blooming things around our house and am thankful for whichever previous owner did that work for me to enjoy!

- I have fully bought in to the year-round school calendar. Our oldest is on a three-week break for spring right now and I absolutely love these longer breaks throughout the year, rather than a longer summer. Summer is going to feel squeezed (she only gets 5 weeks off for summer), for sure, but having these more regular long breaks has been much needed every time they come around.

- Our kids hardcore pretend-play pretty much all the time, and one of my favorite things to do is ask them questions about whichever story or world they're living in the moment. This season with them has been the most precious. 

- I introduced our oldest to the [*Boxcar Children*](https://amzn.to/4j4F4E0){:target="_blank"} series and it's such a joy watching her enjoy the books I loved so much as a kid.
