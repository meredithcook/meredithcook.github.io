It has been a sad week in our community and household as one of our favorite professors passed away after a battle with cancer. We loved and deeply respected Dr. Harper, and he was a great encouragement to both of us. We are sad that he is gone, but we are grateful that he is fully healed and in the presence of Jesus. So, while this is a more sad intro to this monthly post, I wanted to honor his memory.

# Reads

## Books

- [*What in the World*](https://amzn.to/4iA6roL){:target="_blank"} by Leanne Morgan. I have been on a memoir kick this year, and Leanne Morgan's memoir is a funny and quick read. I discovered her on YouTube and honestly thought she was doing a bit with her accent, until I watched enough videos to realize that it's real. I enjoy her comedy, especially as a female quickly approaching (or already approaching?) middle age. I did find that I was familiar with many of its anecdotes because I've watched enough of her stand-up routine. However, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of levity in their reading. 

## Articles

### [Missions, Illnesses and God](https://www.thecgcs.org/resources/post/missions-illnesses-and-god/?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}
Scarlett Johnson
<br>CGCS

Scarlett is a type-1 diabetic who also serves as a missionary overseas. In this article, she discusses how God's purposes carry forth despite our perceived limitations. It is full of hope and encouragement to follow God's call and trust His character throughout all of our struggles.

### [The Paradox of Ease: Why Friction is Good for You](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/paradox-ease/?__readwiseLocation){:target="_blank"}
Trevin Wax
<br>TGC

In an article that I desperately needed to read (and really, that many Americans need to read), Trevin Wax argues that facing challenges and experiencing resistance are essential for personal growth and happiness. This is counter to so much of the American way, particularly in recent generations.

### [High Agency in 30 Minutes](https://www.highagency.com/?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}

I am not a high agency person, but I am married to one. This is an entertaining look at what makes a person "High Agency" and while it may not make you High Agency, it's interesting to read about people who were.

The title is pretty straightforward, but I enjoyed this fun read reflecting on church coffee.

### [Combat Anxiety Through Surrender](https://www.challies.com/articles/combat-anxiety-through-surrender/?__readwiseLocation=){:target="_blank"}

As someone who struggles with anxiety, one of the hardest character traits of God for me to wrap my mind around his His sovereignty. I grasp for control to try to alleviate anxiety. This article is a helpful corrective to that tendency and a reminder of a better way to fight anxiety.

# Things I'm Loving

- Hosting people in our home. During the last half of last year, we stepped back (a little, not completely) from having people over as regularly to try to get my husband through the finish line of his PhD. Now that he's finished, we've returned to having people over as frequently as we had been and I have been reminded of how much I love it.

- Volunteering at my daughter's school. Growing up, my mom was always helping out at my school and it was important to me to be present at my daughter's school as much as I can with a full-time job and a younger child still at home. But, I have grown to really enjoy volunteering when I can and I was able to be there for a couple of events this month.

- Taking my daughter to coffee shops. There is something bittersweet about watching your kids get older and realizing they'll never be a baby again, but there is so much fun in taking them to do things we both enjoy when they're old enough to do so. She loves taking a book and getting a hot chocolate to drink while she reads.

- My son's servant-heart. I think anyone can learn to serve well, but some people just seem to have a natural inclination to service. While he's only 4, he seems to have such a gift for serving others. I'm just praying that persists!
